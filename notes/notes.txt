- TODO:
    - Error when an editor driving a train rammed another train and did damage and I then tried to get out of the train.

- Graphics:
    - Add direction indicator to placement graphics to help with snapping to stations.
    - Make graphics for new vehicle (cargo wagon entity).
    - Make graphics for wheels both ends (wheels on locos) - Use half the wheel graphics with connctors facing outwards as will be 2 copies on each loco entity. Needs white space adding to the end of each sprite sheets when remade to space them. Can't be the loco entity picture as this can't have its render layer set and so wheels will overlap wagon in some orientations.
    - Allow color to be pasted on the cargo wagon as it has the graphics. Copy from WagonColors mod.
    - Vertical cargo and fluid unit's graphics aren't aligned correctly. Most noticable that the pump doesn't align correctly on graphics.
	- Add a second graphic option to use a tram render suggested by Klonan: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/tatra-t3-76aa08d7c06340fc89229551c45e3c3a

- Deferred:
    - Handle other mods placeing our placement entity. By raising events it may trigger mods that currently ignore us. i.e.
         - Renai Transportation
    - Chase up with other mods support for mine:
        - Electric Trains
	- Look at compatibility with SpaceX and Krastorio 2.
	- Electronic Locomotives & Electronic Factorio Extended Locomotives (this shows how to use the remote call to register)
	- Support for bobs trains: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/boblogistics
	- Support for bobs vehicle equipment: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bobvehicleequipment
	- Do a single ended version, with a 4 tile large cargo area.

- Not Possible (presently):
    - Share color settings on the 2 locos and apply to the single combined graphic. No simple event to flag when color is changed so not sure how to detect this. Maybe train the train GUI being opened/closed and apply colors then ?
    - Prevent the player from walking through a unit. As there needs to be gaps in the parts collision boes so it can turn corners.
    - Be able to detach single unit trains from other rolling stock. Not possible as the event is identical for when each part of a single unit train is being attached as to when a user tries to detach it. I currently track whne the unit is broken up and rejoin the correct bit. I would then need to track the joined event and somehow track which the old end of train unit part was and then detach the next non unit part of the train. Can't do it in the origonal event so will get very messy.
